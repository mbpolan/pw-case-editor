--------------------------
PLEASE REMEMBER:
The Phoenix Wright Case Editor
(pw-case-editor.sf.net)
is not a finished product (by any means).
--------------------------

This means, almost non-existent documentation (Doxygen, triggers and file format), and (perhaps) a not very clean UI.

After this notice of dire warning, please feel free to compile with:
sh bootstrap.sh
./configure
make

The output will be into the src directory. If you wish to install, please run make install after the above steps.
